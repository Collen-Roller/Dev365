# Dev365
This is the challenge of all challenges. 365 days of programing one problem per day. No restrictions on languages, no restrictions on problems. The only requirement is that any problem that's started must be completed in 24 hours by a single developer. The aim at this project to turn a good programmer into a great programmer. You can see the log below to observe all of the new concepts I've encountered, or just to see me rant why things aren't working right.
